# Profile Picture Upload Implementation - Summary and Next Steps

## Changes Made:

1. **Fixed Function Name**:

   - Corrected the mismatch between `uploadProfileImage()` and `uploadProfilePicture()` in `EditProfileScreen.dart`
   - Modified the function call to match `SupabaseService.uploadProfilePicture()`

2. **Improved Error Handling**:

   - Added detailed error logging in `SupabaseService.uploadProfilePicture()`
   - Separated image upload errors from profile update errors
   - Added proper file validation and checks
   - Created `DebugUtils.dart` for better debugging capabilities

3. **Storage Configuration**:
   - Created SQL scripts for Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies in `sql/create_storage_policies.sql`
   - Added comprehensive documentation in `supabase_storage_setup.md`

## Next Steps:

### 1. Set Up Supabase Storage Bucket

Before testing the application, you must create and configure the "images" bucket in Supabase:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage in the left sidebar
3. Click "Create new bucket" and name it "images" (exactly as written)
4. Apply the Row Level Security policies from `sql/create_storage_policies.sql`
   - You can copy and paste these into the SQL Editor in Supabase

### 2. Test the Profile Picture Upload

After configuring the storage bucket:

1. Run the app
2. Log in with a valid account
3. Navigate to the Profile screen
4. Tap "Edit Profile"
5. Tap the camera icon to select an image
6. Save the profile
7. Check if the image appears correctly in your profile

### 3. Known Limitations & Future Improvements

- Currently, there are no image size limits or format restrictions
- Consider adding image compression to reduce storage and bandwidth usage
- Add progress indicators during file uploads for better UX
- Implement image cropping functionality to allow users to adjust their profile pictures

### 4. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the application logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify Supabase bucket "images" exists and has the correct policies
3. Make sure the user is authenticated before trying to upload
4. Check file permissions on the device

### 5. Optional Enhancements

- Add a "Remove Profile Picture" option
- Implement image caching for better performance
- Add animation effects during profile picture changes

## Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Create Supabase "images" bucket
- [ ] Apply RLS policies
- [ ] Verify login functionality
- [ ] Test profile picture upload from gallery
- [ ] Verify profile picture display after upload
- [ ] Test error handling with invalid images
- [ ] Check profile picture persistence after app restart
